## Self intro
**About My Experience**

With over 6 years of IT experience, I've developed a strong expertise in front-end development, specializing in React JS.

**Career Journey**

I began my career in 2019 at Infosys, where I worked for 2 years before moving to Accenture. Throughout my journey, I've had the opportunity to work on multiple React JS projects with prominent clients, like:
  - Macy's: on a unified pricing system - helps shop keepers & dealers with real time pricing.
  - Intel: on SPARK application - to maintain and accumulate details about the processors and chipsets.
  - Unilever: on a loyalty program - resposible for providing coupons, loyalty points to the best dealers
    
I'm currently working with Meta: on CRM (Customer Relationship Management), supporting existing clients and building new ones.

**Tech stack**

while working on these project I have developed strong foundation in skills like JS with ES6 features, HTML, CSS, react JS with functional components & new hooks, redux, git & I worked with many libraries like XLSX, react i18Next manymore(typeahead, axios, dake picker, domPurify, redux thunk etc) 

**Future Prospects**

I'm excited to leverage my expertise and experience in future projects, continuing to learn and grow as a professional. This is the brief overview about my experience, career journey & tech stack so far.

## Strengths
1. **I'm always open to learning new things to improve my tech stack.**
   - For example, here at Meta, I had to learn GraphQL to handle APIs, whereas until now, I only had the chance to work with Axios and Fetch.
   - Even though it's tough to balance learning and delivering simultaneously, I took it up with excitement and made sure I delivered my tasks on time.
2. **I’m very detail-oriented**
   - I always try to document as much as possible — including what I’m going to develop, the current situation, and any dependencies
   - And I share it with the team so that expectations are set correctly and everyone is on the same page.
3. I also maintain a **troubleshooting document** for all bugs along with their resolutions.
   - Recently, we had a new joiner in our team, and we both worked on one of the pages where several issues were raised.
   - After giving the KT session, I have shared the trouble shooting doc with him, which helped him to understand the context and resolve the issues quickly.
   - It saved a lot of time for both of us.
  
## Weakness
1. I tend to spend a lot of time on root cause analysis, even though we idenfied the issue.
2. But I strongly believe that it would help us to resolve the issue permanantly
3. And help us in future if we face a similar issue

## Say NO/challenging situation/Pressure situations:
1. There was this situation during my time at Intel.
2. One of our experienced developers left, and we had to replace them with a fresher due to budget issues.
3. But the story points and deliverables weren’t adjusted — they remained the same.
4. As a result, I ended up working almost double the time.
5. I had to guide the new joiner, explain the requirements, support her work, and deliver my own tasks as well.
6. But at times, it became really challenging, and I missed a few of my deliveries and deadlines.
7. At that point, I realized that this setup wasn’t going to work, so I clearly communicated it to my manager — and he supported me.
8. I had to say no, because there was literally no work-life balance, and the setup wasn’t helping us deliver effectively either.
9. So, I requested either extra help or a revision of the story points.

## If above question repeated say below
1. There was a situation where I gave an estimation but couldn’t deliver on time.
2. I clearly communicated the situation to the team as soon as I realized there might be a delay.
3. When we couldn’t resolve the issue collaboratively, I took ownership and informed the client directly.
4. I explained exactly why it would take more time, how much of the feature was completed, and even gave a demo of the partially working functionality to keep them in the loop.
5. From that experience, I always make sure to include a buffer in my estimates to handle unexpected delays.

## Challenge during early stages of my career

## EXPLAIN AGILE
1. Agile is a methodology where software development is done through small and quick releases.
2. Work is divided into short cycles called sprints.
3. Every day, we have stand-up meetings where we discuss task progress, raise blockers, and get help from the team if needed.
4. Agile helps us focus clearly on what needs to be done and enables faster delivery.
5. At the end of each sprint, we have a retrospective to discuss what went well, what didn’t, and how we can improve in the next sprint based on our experience.

Tool used: JIRA

## What you liked about AGILE
1. Quick deliveries
2. NO pressure on the final goal, instead can be achieve with short goals
3. Daily stand up helps us to get our blockers resolved

## What can be improved in AGILE
1. daily stand-ups quick and focused — they shouldn't turn into long meetings or unnecessary extensions.
2. Also, team members shouldn't wait for others to update their task status during the call.
3. One simple solution could be to schedule a 5–10 minute calendar block just before the stand-up, where everyone updates their tasks in the board or tool.

## Achievements
1. One of my key achievements from the start of my career was during my time at Infosys. We had a strong training program, and I scored over 90% in the final assessment, for which I received a 25K cash prize.
2. After that, I took a hands-on exam and got certified as an Infosys React Professional.
3. While working at Accenture, I cleared a another exam and secured P3 proficiency in React.
4. Currently at client site Meta, we have an internal recognition system where employees get appreciated through Thanks app & badges. So far, I’ve been received two thanks and 11 badges like Bug Detector, Code Cleaner, and Wiki Enhancer.
